# 10 Cool Library Things To Do in Quarantine

Here we are: Corona. The library will remain closed. No more users in the building. You're deathly bored. Maybe you are even in quarantine yourself. The most important thing now is to stay calm, follow the instructions of the authorities and not to put yourself and others senselessly in danger of infection. Again, you may now have time to finally devote yourself to things that you have had little time for in the everyday life of a librarian. Things that are actually much cooler than sorting books, setting up WLAN for users or collecting metadata (I know this is an assumption and sorting books can be cool. But hey, aren't it always the cool things you don't have time for!?). For those of you who don't have a family, don't like to walk outside (you should try it sometime), or have already watched all the series on Netflix twice, we've put together a small list of recommendations on how to pass the time until users return to your library.
