# 10 Cool Library Things To Do in Quarantine

Here we are: Corona. The library will remain closed. No more users in the building. You're deathly bored. Maybe you are even in quarantine yourself. The most important thing now is to stay calm, follow the instructions of the authorities and not to put yourself and others senselessly in danger of infection. Again, you may now have time to finally devote yourself to things that you have had little time for in the everyday life of a librarian. Things that are actually much cooler than sorting books, setting up WLAN for users or collecting metadata (I know this is an assumption and sorting books can be cool. But hey, aren't it always the cool things you don't have time for!?). For those of you who don't have a family, don't like to walk outside (you should try it sometime), or have already watched all the series on Netflix twice, we've put together a small list of recommendations on how to pass the time until users return to your library.

## 1 Awesome Lists

...since you are already here on github we want to start with [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) att . Awesome lists include collections of links to __awesome__ projects and __awesome__ websites on a specific topic. On the awesome lists overview page on GitHub there are awesome lists for programming languages, content management systems, 

And hey, there is even an [awesome library](https://github.com/ubleipzig/awesome-library) list that waits for improvements.

## 2 Openscience Mooc

That's an easy one. The [Openscience MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/) [Open Principles](https://opensciencemooc.eu/modules/open-principles/) and [Open Research Software and Open Source](https://opensciencemooc.eu/modules/open-research-software-and-open-source/).

## 8 Play around with Linux

Playing around always sounds like fun. Probably this one has been on your list for a while already, but hell have you been awfully busy these last few years. So now there is no excuse, go for some Linux flavour, grab a USB Stick, download the [Linux distribution](https://distrowatch.com/) of your choice, [install it on the USB stick](https://www.pendrivelinux.com/) and then rock that penguin. There are uncountable different Linux distributions, here is [an article](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-distros) that might help for the first time Linux user. When we started (and this is what we still recommend first timers) we used [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) which is user friendly and quite stable.

## 9 Annif

[Annif](http://annif.org/) is a tool for automated subject indexing and classification and you can directly try it out on the project's website. The code is open source (Apache License 2.0) and developed by the [National Library of Finland](https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en/). When we first stumbled upon Annif, the [video introducing Annif](https://vimeo.com/212577974) has definitely been stuck in our minds.

## 10 SciHub

So yeah, this is a dirty one. Since now you are at home and no one spies around you, you can finally try it. The one and only search engine for license freed scientific articles, [SciHub](https://sci-hub.se/). Look around and feel the beauty of unlimited and instant access. If it happens (what happens) that the link to the website is broken, just try another top level domain like .si, .tw or .tp (see <https://sci-hub.now.sh/> for updated links).
